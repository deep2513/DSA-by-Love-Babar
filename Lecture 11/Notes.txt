Time Complexity

-> it is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run
-> as a function of length of the input

why ?
-> for making better programs
-> comparision opf algo.

Big O notation -> upper bound
Theta notation -> for avg case complexity
omega notation -> lower bound

constant time -> O(1)
Linear time > O(n)
Logarithmic time -> O(log n)
Quadratic time -> O(n^2)
Cubic time -> O(n^3)
